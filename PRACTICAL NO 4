INTRODUCTION:
1.NFS (Network File System) which is basically used to share the files and folders between Linux systems.
2. It allows us to mount the file system in the network and remote users can interact and the share just like local file and folders.

1.Install NFS Kernel Server
$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Step 2: Create the Export Directory
The directory that we want to share with the client system is called an export directory,we are creating an export directory by thename of “tycs” in our system’s mnt(mount) 
directory specifying a mount folder name, through the following command as root:
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/tycs

As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive permissions of the export folder:
$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/tycs
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/tycs

Step 3: Assign server access to client(s) through NFS export file
we will need to provide the clients the permission to access the host server machine. This permission is defined through the exports file located 
in your system’s /etc folder. 
$ sudo nano /etc/exports

Once you have opened the file, you can allow access to:
A single client by adding the following line in the file:
/mnt/tycs clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/tycs subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check

rw: read and write operations
sync: write any change to the disc before applying it
no_subtree_check: prevent subtree checking

Step 4: Export the shared directory
After making all the above configurations in the host system, now is the time to export the shared directory:
$ sudo exportfs -a

Restart the NFS Kernel server as follows:
$sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s)
An important step is to verify that the server’s firewall is open to the clients so that they can access the shared content:
$ sudo ufw allow from [clientIP or clientSubnetIP] to any port nfs

In our example, we are giving access to an entire subnet of clients machines:
$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.100/24 to any port nfs

Now when you check the status of your Ubuntu firewall through the following command, you will be able to view the Action status as “Allow” for the client’s IP.
$ sudo ufw status

Configuring the Client Machine
Step 1: Install NFS Common
Before installing the NFS Common application, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:
$ sudo apt-get update

Run the following command in order to install the NFS Common client on your system:
$ sudo apt-get install nfs-common

Step 2: Create a mount point for the NFS host’s shared folder
Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create this folder anywhere on your system. 
We are creating a mount folder in the mnt directory of our client’s machine:
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/tycs_client

Step 3: Mount the shared directory on the client
Use the following command in order to mount the shared folder from the host to a mount folder on the client:
$ sudo mount serverIP:/exportFolder_server /mnt/mountfolder_client
$ sudo mount 192.168.100.5:/mnt/tycs /mnt/tycs_client

Step 4: Test the connection
Please create or save a file in the export folder of the NFS host server. Now, open the mount folder on the client machine; you should be able to view the same file shared and  
accessible in this folder.
