AIM:Install DHCP Server in Ubuntu 16.04
INTRODUTION:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network protocol that is used to enable host computers to be automatically assigned IP addresses and related network configurations from a server.
The IP address assigned by a DHCP server to DHCP client is on a “lease”, the lease time normally varies depending on how long a client computer is likely to require the connection or DHCP configuration.
STEPS:
1.command  to install the DCHP server package
        $ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
When the installation completes, edit the file /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server to define the interfaces DHCPD should use to serve DHCP request.
The main DHCP configuration file         is /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf, you must add all your network information to be sent to clients here.
Now, open and modify the main configuration file, define your DHCP server options:
        $ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.
. Now, define a subnetwork; 
here, we’ll setup DHCP for 192.168.10.0/24 LAN network.
