INTRODUCTION:
1.Secure Shell, sometimes referred to as Secure Socket Shell, is a protocol which allows you to connect securely to a remote computer or a server by using a text-based interface.
2.When a secure SSH connection is established, a shell session will be started, and you will be able to manipulate the server by typing commands within the client on your local 
computer.

To enable SSH password authentication, you must SSH in as root to edit this file:
1./etc/ssh/sshd_config
2.Then, change:
PasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes
3.After making that change, restart the SSH service by running the following command as root:
sudo service ssh restart

To check if the client is available or not you will need to:
1.Load an SSH terminal. You can either search for “terminal” or press CTRL + ALT + T on your keyboard.
2.Type in ssh and press Enter in the terminal.
3.If the client is installed, you will receive a response that looks like this:
username@host:~$ ssh

STEPS TO INSTALL SSH CLIENT:
Run the following command to install the OpenSSH client on your computer: 
1.sudo apt-get install openssh-client
2.Type in your superuser password when asked.
3.Enter to complete the installation.

TO INSTALL OPENSSH SERVER
1.sudo apt-get install openssh-server ii.
2.Enter and Y to allow the installation
you can check if the SSH server is running on the machine by typing:
sudo service ssh status
3.you can change the default port for SSH connections.
 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

If you need to install Nano, run this command:
sudo apt-get install nano

We need to restart SSH service every time we make any changes to the sshd_config file:
sudo service ssh restart

you can establish a secure remote connection with your servers. To do so:
Open the SSH terminal on your machine and run the following command
1.ssh your_username@host_ip_address
If the username on  machine matches the one on the server type:
2.ssh host_ip_address
3.Type in your password and enter.
